# But why?

I just need to make sure I remember everything the next time I need to update this bad boy.

# Requirements

This was done on Ubuntu 22.04.

Just download Texlive:
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install texlive
```

# Do the thing

Edit `resume.tex`. Then do `. build.sh` to compile and view the new PDF. That's it.

# Conclusion

This probably didn't need a README.
